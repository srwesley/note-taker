# Note Taker
Assignment application for Week 11 - Express.js for bootcamp

## Task
Creating a note taker application using express.js, as well as NPM Inquirer, and UUID.

The application starts up on an index/home page where upon pressing a "Get Started" button, loads up the actaul app, where the user enters in a note title and text and then can save that note, through a save button in the upper right corner, to the list of sample notes provided. The user can also click on any note to load the full note with text on the screen, and can reset it to add a new note by pressing a plus sign also in the upper right corner of the screen. The user can also click the "Note Taker" title in the upper left corner and return to the index/home page.

Then for the bonus, the user can click on the red trash can symbols on the right end of any note and delete that note from the list. 

For the sample notes, as well as any new note added are saved on a db.json file, and deleting a note on the app should also remove that note from the db.json file.
